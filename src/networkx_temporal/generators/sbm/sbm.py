    Returns a temporal graph using dynamic SBM.

    The dynamic Stochastic Block Model (SBM) [1]_ is a degree-corrected generative model for
    temporal network structures. It is a generalization of SBM that allows for the generation of networks
    with evolving community structures, where the probability of edges between nodes and their
    community memberships is fixed, but nodes may transition community over time.

    The model is defined by a block matrix :math:`\\mathbf{B}`, a transition matrix
    :math:`\\boldsymbol{\\tau}`, a node degree vector :math:`\\mathbf{d}`, and a node community
    vector :math:`\\mathbf{z}`, which are used to generate the network at each time step:

    .. math::
        \\mathbf{B} = \\begin{pmatrix}
        b_{11} & b_{12} & \\cdots & b_{1k} \\\\
        b_{21} & b_{22} & \\cdots & b_{2k} \\\\
        \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\
        b_{k1} & b_{k2} & \\cdots & b_{kk}
        \\end{pmatrix},
        \\,
        \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\begin{pmatrix}
        \\tau_{11} & \\tau_{12} & \\cdots & \\tau_{1k} \\\\
        \\tau_{21} & \\tau_{22} & \\cdots & \\tau_{2k} \\\\
        \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\
        \\tau_{k1} & \\tau_{k2} & \\cdots & \\tau_{kk}
        \\end{pmatrix},
        \\,
        \\mathbf{d} = \\begin{pmatrix}
        d_{1} \\\\
        d_{2} \\\\
        \\vdots \\\\
        d_{n}
        \\end{pmatrix},
        \\,
        \\mathbf{z} = \\begin{pmatrix}
        z_{1} \\\\
        z_{2} \\\\
        \\vdots \\\\
        z_{n}
        \\end{pmatrix},

    where :math:`k` is the number of communities
    and :math:`n` is the number of nodes in the network.

    At each time step, the model generates a network by sampling edges between nodes
    according to the block matrix :math:`\\mathbf{B}` and the transition matrix
    :math:`\\boldsymbol{\\tau}`. The degree vector :math:`\\mathbf{d}` is used to determine
    the number of edges for each node and is kept fixed across snapshots, while the community
    vector :math:`\\mathbf{z}` is used to determine the community membership of each node
    in the initial snapshot only.

    :param block_matrix: Block matrix used to generate the network.
    :param degree_vector: Degree vector used to generate the network.
    :param community_vector: Community vector used to generate the network.
    :param transition_matrix: Transition matrix used for snapshots.
        If ``None``, nodes do not transition communities over time.
    :param snapshots: Number of time steps to generate.
    :param selfloops: If ``True``, self-loops are allowed. Default is ``False``.
    :param directed: Whether edges are directed. Defaults to ``True``.
    :param multigraph: Allows parallel edges. Defaults to ``True``.
    :param create_using: Graph constructor to use.
    :param keep_transition: If ``True``, node transition probabilities refer
        to its community in the previous snapshot. Default is ``False``.
