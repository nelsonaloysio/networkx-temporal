    Returns the modularity of a graph.

    Modularity [3]_ measures the fraction of edges in a graph that fall within communities,
    compared to their expected number if randomly placed in a network with the same order,
    size, and degree distribution (i.e., according to the configuration model). It is classically
    defined as:

    .. math::

        Q =
        \\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{(i,j) \\in V^2}
        \\left[ \\mathbf{A}_{ij} - \\gamma \\frac{k_i k_j}{2m} \\right]
        \\delta(c_i, c_j),

    where
    :math:`m` is the number of (undirected) edges in the graph,
    :math:`(i,j) \\in V^2` are node pairs,
    :math:`\\mathbf{A}` is the adjacency matrix,
    :math:`k` and are node degrees,
    :math:`c` are their communities,
    and :math:`\\gamma = 1` (default) is the resolution parameter,
    where larger values favor smaller communities [4]_.
    It can be reduced to:

    .. math::

        Q = \\sum_{c \\in C} \\left[ \\frac{L_c}{m}
        - \\gamma \\left( \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in c} k_i}{2m} \\right)^2 \\right],

    where
    :math:`m` is the number of edges in the graph,
    :math:`L_c` is the number of edges within community :math:`c`,
    :math:`i \\in c` is a node in the community,
    :math:`k_i` is its degree,
    and :math:`\\gamma` is the resolution parameter.

    Longitudinal modularity [6]_ is a generalization of the metric for temporal graphs, which adds
